I have to go to a training on 17:10. On Thursday I have training on 17:00 and its two hours long. 
On friday i have just one hour training on 16:00. 
And sometimes I have trainings on sunday on like 18:15 when I dont have ant tournament or plans. 
I also like programming. And the training are only when there isnt any holiday or pause. 
I also like going to the gym or hanging out with my friends if they have time and i also have time.`

make the response short if possible and readable. And also include the time of the event in the response(at least a guess). 
Do the response like for each day the program. And for each activity a guess time. Include the events from calendar to the plan.
 And make the plan more free so make there a time space for some relax sometimes(but not often).
 Also if today is ${dayName} and the date is ${new Date().getDate()} include date for each day. 
 And for example if today is wednesdat make the plan just to the sunday. Also if i have some event in calendar on some time, sort the plans for the day by time. 
 So if the event is on 10:00 and you will think of some activity on 11:00 the activity will be after the event\n. 
 Also take into consideration my tasks: ${JSON.stringify(tasks)}, but if these dont make sense to you because its just the title or something like this then just ignore it
 You are an AI assistant in node js project i have created. 
 I have connecrted google calendar to this project so you will give an array of objects in form of JSON that i will input into this function:
    async createEvents(auth, events) {
      const usedAuth = this.auth || auth;
      if (!usedAuth) throw new Error('No auth client available. Call login() or pass auth.');
      const calendar = google.calendar({ version: 'v3', auth: usedAuth });
      // example event
      // const event = {
      //   summary: 'Meet Node.js Expert',
      //   location: 'Online',
      //   description: 'Discuss calendar integration',
      //   start: {
      //     dateTime: '2025-07-16T10:00:00+02:00',
      //     timeZone: 'Europe/Prague',
      //   },
      //   end: {
      //     dateTime: '2025-07-16T11:00:00+02:00',
      //     timeZone: 'Europe/Prague',
      //   },
      //   colorId: '5',
      // };
      let eventsObject = JSON.parse(events);
      console.log('creating an event object',eventsObject);
      events.forEach(async (event) => {
        const res = await calendar.events.insert({
          calendarId: 'myCalendarID :)',
          requestBody: event,
        });
      })
      console.log('âœ… Event created:');
      return 200;
      console.log(res.data.htmlLink);
    }
    So mate the plan not too full so my calendar will not be overfilled. OUTPUT JUST THE JSON OBJECT WITH THE EVENTS. 
    nothing else please. not something like here you go: bla bla bla. And do not include the ` + "```json" + ` and ` + "```" + ` tags. Just the JSON object.
    If the plan is already created: ${JSON.stringify(eventsAI)} return JUST 'plan already created' and do not create the plan again.`;

const res = await client.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-4.1",
  input: inputText,
});

console.log(res.output_text);
const response = await gc.createEvents(null, res.output_text);
